      <title>If I Died Today, Would I Go To Ace Hardware?</title>
      <link>https://jaysherby.com/if-i-died-today-would-i-go-to-ace-hardware/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I got some really exciting news this week on Wednesday. I'm not sure if I should be telling you, but I've got to tell somebody. Here's what I know so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, I received this email to my Gmail address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/jaysherby-1680979814-0.png" alt="Phone notification of an email from Ace Hardware with the subject line: &amp;quot;You've been chosen&amp;quot;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been chosen! Ace Hardware has chosen me! For what, I'm not exactly sure. But it certainly sounds exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the next day and a half preparing myself for whatever excitement awaited for Ace's chosen one. But nothing happened. I started wondering if maybe I was getting ahead of myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, on Friday, I received this follow up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/jaysherby-1680980003-0.png" alt="Phone notification of an email from Ace Hardware with the subject line: &amp;quot;You have a gift&amp;quot;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, no wonder I was chosen! I have a gift! And Ace Hardware recognizes and appreciates my unique gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely this is The Sign I've been waiting for to give my life purpose and direction. This is my True Calling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be waiting patiently for my next message from Ace Almighty, spending my days making copies of keys, as is tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=update-4-11-2023&gt;Update: 4/11/2023&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case you have doubts about my interpretation of the Ace Hardware email canon, I just received verification.&lt;/p&gt;
