    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently received a spam email from Target Optical.  Subject line: "Happy Valentineâ€™s Day! ðŸ’•".  Thanks, Target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, I clicked on the unsubscribe link on the bottom of the email and I was met with...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/jaysherby-1678328483-0.png" alt="Oh, no! I forgot to censor my email address!! Whatever. Worst anyone could do would be re-adding me to Target Optical's mailing list." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was aghast. I'd already had a rough day with software. This was the little push required to send me over the edge.  I laughed.  I cried.  I called my wife over to mercilessly mock this abject failure of usability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My best guess was to select the "yes" radio button and click the "submit" button.  I didn't have the patience to poke around. But what would "no" and "submit" mean?  Is that meaningfully different from "cancel"?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not as bad as &lt;a href='https://dinosaurenby.medium.com/a-deep-dive-into-the-ux-of-the-nostromos-self-destruct-procedure-9eda80793fe8'&gt;the self-destruct interface for the Nostromo&lt;/a&gt;. If an alien creature was hunting me while I was trying to unsubscribe from this mailing list, I might not be as charitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, my best guess was correct. And my piece of cheese for solving this UX puzzle?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/jaysherby-1678329253-0.png" alt="Unlike the previous image, this one has not been edited. Not one pixel." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfect. Ten out of ten.  No notes.  ðŸ¤¦&lt;/p&gt;
