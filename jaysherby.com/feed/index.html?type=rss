      <title>Can I Roll My Own State Container For React?</title>
      <link>https://jaysherby.com/can-i-roll-my-own-state-container-for-react/</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was recently chatting with some former coworkers. One of them asked if Redux was still the go-to library for React app state management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was surprised when others brought up some libraries I hadn't heard of called &lt;a href="https://recoiljs.org/"&gt;Recoil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand"&gt;Zustand&lt;/a&gt;. I've reviewed them briefly, and it looks like they each bring interesting benefits and improvements over bog-standard Redux. Without having actually used either of them, that's really the most I can say about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time I worked on a React app that benefited from the type of state container that Redux provides was around five years ago. I used Redux at that time. I've still used React since then, but the apps I've worked on have synchronized their Big State‚Ñ¢Ô∏è via their back-ends. I've found React's built-in hooks to be adequate for the rest. I'll reach for third-party libraries for form management, but otherwise the built-in hooks and custom hooks composed from them tend to do the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point since the &lt;code&gt;useReducer&lt;/code&gt; hook landed, the notion that Redux isn't really necessary anymore stuck in my brain. You should be able to roll your own version using React's core features now, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I think of Redux, I think of three main features: The Reducer‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, the ability to access the state container from arbitrary components without having to pass stuff up and down the tree, and selectors. In the version I'm going to throw together here, the reducer and state container are provided by &lt;code&gt;useReducer&lt;/code&gt;, and the arbitrary component state container access will be provided by a React context. Selectors should be an implementation detail. üëÄ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the bit that should be the same across any application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="tsx"&gt;import React, {
  Context,
  Dispatch,
  ReactNode,
  Reducer,
  createContext,
  useContext,
  useReducer
} from "react";

type StoreContext&amp;lt;S, A&amp;gt; = Context&amp;lt;{ state: S; dispatch: Dispatch&amp;lt;A&amp;gt; }&amp;gt;;

interface Props&amp;lt;S, A&amp;gt; {
  context: StoreContext&amp;lt;S, A&amp;gt;;
  reducer: Reducer&amp;lt;S, A&amp;gt;;
  children: ReactNode;
}

export function createStoreContext&amp;lt;S, A&amp;gt;(initialState: S): StoreContext&amp;lt;S, A&amp;gt; {
  return createContext({
    state: initialState,
    dispatch: (() =&amp;gt; {}) as Dispatch&amp;lt;A&amp;gt;
  });
}

export function Store&amp;lt;S, A&amp;gt;({
  children,
  context: Context,
  reducer
}: Props&amp;lt;S, A&amp;gt;) {
  const { state: initialState } = useContext(Context);
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
  return (
    &amp;lt;Context.Provider value={{ state, dispatch }}&amp;gt;{children}&amp;lt;/Context.Provider&amp;gt;
  );
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've created a convenience function called &lt;code&gt;createStoreContext&lt;/code&gt; that takes an initial state and returns a context that will hold your app's state. The only thing that might be considered tricky here is that I'm using a no-op function as the placeholder for the dispatch function until the context is provided to the &lt;code&gt;Store&lt;/code&gt; component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Store&lt;/code&gt; component is what I'd call a surrogate context provider component. I made up that word salad just now to describe it, but it's a common pattern. It acts like a context provider, but it adds the logic for how the context is going to be used. In this case, that logic is just the &lt;code&gt;useReducer&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I'll set up the app-specific types and logic for a contrived example app. This app has two pieces of state: a string and a number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="typescript"&gt;import { createStoreContext } from "./Store";

interface State {
  number: number;
  text: string;
}

type Action =
  | { type: "INCREMENT_NUMBER" | "DECREMENT_NUMBER" }
  | { type: "CHANGE_TEXT"; updatedText: string };

const initialState: State = {
  number: 50,
  text: "initial text"
};

function reduceText(state: string, action: Action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "CHANGE_TEXT":
      return action.updatedText;

    default:
      return state;
  }
}

function reduceNumber(state: number, action: Action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "INCREMENT_NUMBER":
      return state + 1;

    case "DECREMENT_NUMBER":
      return state - 1;

    default:
      return state;
  }
}

export function reducer(state: State, action: Action): State {
  return {
    number: reduceNumber(state.number, action),
    text: reduceText(state.text, action)
  };
}

export const AppState = createStoreContext&amp;lt;State, Action&amp;gt;(initialState);
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you were able to stay awake through all that. I made some opinionated choices about composing reducers, but any valid reducer function will work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to create the context instance in this file rather than in the root &lt;code&gt;App&lt;/code&gt; component to make the dependency tree a little cleaner since every component that connects to our state container will depend on that context instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the root &lt;code&gt;App&lt;/code&gt; component, I'll make that now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="tsx"&gt;import React from "react";
import { Store } from "./Store";
import { AppState, reducer } from "./state";
import TextView from "./TextView";
import NumberView from "./NumberView";
import "./styles.css";

export default function App() {
  return (
    &amp;lt;Store context={AppState} reducer={reducer}&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;div className="App"&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Here's a sample app!&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;TextView /&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;NumberView /&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/Store&amp;gt;
  );
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm passing the &lt;code&gt;AppState&lt;/code&gt; context into the &lt;code&gt;Store&lt;/code&gt; component as well as the app's reducer. I'm going to write two components that directly utilize the app state: TextView and NumberView.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="tsx"&gt;import React, { ChangeEventHandler, useCallback, useContext } from "react";
import { AppState } from "./state";

export default function TextView() {
  const { state, dispatch } = useContext(AppState);
  const handleChange = useCallback&amp;lt;ChangeEventHandler&amp;lt;HTMLInputElement&amp;gt;&amp;gt;(
    (event) =&amp;gt;
      dispatch({ type: "CHANGE_TEXT", updatedText: event.target.value }),
    [dispatch]
  );

  return (
    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Change my text!&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;input type="text" value={state.text} onChange={handleChange} /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
  );
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class="tsx"&gt;import React, { ReactEventHandler, useCallback, useContext } from "react";
import { AppState } from "./state";

export default function NumberView() {
  const { state, dispatch } = useContext(AppState);
  const handleIncrement = useCallback&amp;lt;ReactEventHandler&amp;gt;(
    (event) =&amp;gt; dispatch({ type: "INCREMENT_NUMBER" }),
    [dispatch]
  );
  const handleDecrement = useCallback&amp;lt;ReactEventHandler&amp;gt;(
    (event) =&amp;gt; dispatch({ type: "DECREMENT_NUMBER" }),
    [dispatch]
  );

  return (
    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Current number: {state.number}&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;button onClick={handleIncrement}&amp;gt;+&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;button onClick={handleDecrement}&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
  );
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the app works. I'm using React's &lt;code&gt;useContext&lt;/code&gt; hook directly to access the state and the dispatch function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="My beautiful app" src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/jaysherby-1688085276-0.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's a pretty big problem. Because each component depends on the entire application state, every component re-renders on every state change regardless of whether the change was actually relevant to the component in question. In other words, I need selectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where my hand-rolled scheme falls apart. There's currently no way to avoid these types of unnecessary re-renders while using a single context. No matter what kind of memoization strategies you employ, the &lt;code&gt;useContext&lt;/code&gt; hook will trigger a re-render of every component attached to the context upon a state change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not the only one out there who thinks this is a glaring omission from React's API. There's &lt;a href="https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/119"&gt;an open RFC&lt;/a&gt; for just such a feature that's been hanging out since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; determined to write your own app container only using React primitives, the next place I'd look would be the relatively new &lt;a href="https://react.dev/reference/react/useSyncExternalStore"&gt;&lt;code&gt;useSyncExternalStore&lt;/code&gt; hook&lt;/a&gt;. I'm almost certain you can achieve the desired effects with that hook, but it's just not as interesting. You'd be building Redux from bare JavaScript to interface with the &lt;code&gt;useSyncExternalStore&lt;/code&gt; API without being able to lean on any other built-in hooks. At that point, just use a library.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Typescript, Show Me The Whole Error!</title>
      <link>https://jaysherby.com/typescript-show-me-the-whole-error/</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Has this ever happened to you? Typescript throws an error about two types being incompatible, but the differing parts of the types is truncated from the error!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the default behavior for some reason. I'm not a fan. I know long error messages scare a lot of developers, but I'd rather have a long and helpful error message than a short and useless one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good news! Error message salvation is one &lt;code&gt;tsconfig.json&lt;/code&gt; setting away. Set &lt;a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#noErrorTruncation"&gt;&lt;code&gt;noErrorTruncation&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; and you'll be all set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I'd rather opt in to truncation than opt out, but at least it's an easy fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>React Hook Form: A Leaky Abstraction</title>
      <link>https://jaysherby.com/react-hook-form-a-leaky-abstraction/</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have used a handful of helper libraries for wrangling form state in React over the course of my career. In my current job, we're using React Hook Form&lt;sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, specifically v6, although I think my story might still apply to those using the newer v7 branch. I enjoy working with it for the most part. I've found it to be a lighter-weight alternative to Formik.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this past week I ran into a weird edge case. To set the stage, a friend and colleague&lt;sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; was working on a ticket to add a field to an existing form that's powered by React Hook Form. The new field was a &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;lt;select&amp;amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; style dropdown menu with dynamically populated options based on the user's configuration. This field is required. However, most users will probably only have one option. In that case, we chose not to show this new field at all. Instead, that field will automatically default to the only option available to that user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a tiny example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="typescript"&gt;const { groups } = useUser();

const userHasMultipleGroups = groups.length &amp;gt; 1;

const defaultValues = {
  name: '',
  group: userHasMultipleGroups ? '' : groups[0].value,
};

const { control, handleSubmit, formState: { errors } } = useForm({
  defaultValues,
  resolver: yupResolver(schema),
});

// ...snip...

&amp;lt;Controller
  as={&amp;lt;TextInput /&amp;gt;}
  control={control}
  name="name"
/&amp;gt;

{userHasMultipleGroups &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (
  &amp;lt;Controller
    as={&amp;lt;SelectInput /&amp;gt;}
    control={control}
    name="group"
    options={groups}
  /&amp;gt;
)}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me break this down in words briefly to make sure we're on the same page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This component checks a user's groups, which is provided by a custom hook called &lt;code&gt;useUser&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The form's default value for &lt;code&gt;group&lt;/code&gt; is a blank string if the given user has multiple groups available to them. If the user has just one group, which is the most common case, their group's value is automatically the default value for that form input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, we choose to only render the &lt;code&gt;group&lt;/code&gt; field if there are multiple choices to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, &lt;em&gt;this won't work&lt;/em&gt;. The form works as expected when the user belongs to multiple groups. When there's only one group available, this will fail. On submit, the validation will fail, claiming there's no value for the &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;quot;group&amp;amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What gives? We set the default value for that field! Making things even more confusing, if we add a logging statement like &lt;code&gt;console.log(getValues())&lt;/code&gt;, it will log an empty object until we start interacting with the form. It's like the default values aren't being used at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After futzing around for a couple of hours and getting nowhere, here's the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;getValues()&lt;/code&gt; doesn't know anything about &lt;code&gt;defaultValues&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The values in &lt;code&gt;defaultValues&lt;/code&gt; won't propagate into the form's values unless the form &lt;em&gt;actually renders an input&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similarly, using &lt;code&gt;setValue()&lt;/code&gt; in a &lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt; hook, for example, won't work for any field in the form that doesn't have an actual input rendered on the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is actually mentioned in the documentation, but it's not exactly front and center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its not default state for the form, to include additional form values:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Register hidden input: &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;lt;input type=&amp;amp;quot;hidden&amp;amp;quot; ref={register} name=&amp;amp;quot;test&amp;amp;quot; /&amp;amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combine values at onSubmit callback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- &lt;a href="https://legacy.react-hook-form.com/v6/api#useForm"&gt;React Hook Form docs for &lt;code&gt;useForm&lt;/code&gt;, specifically under &lt;code&gt;defaultValues&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This little tidbit is what tipped me off to this situation.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-3"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also a clue in the FAQs for v7 in the answer for the question, "How to work with modal or tab forms?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to understand React Hook Form embraces native form behavior by storing input state inside each input (except custom &lt;code&gt;register&lt;/code&gt; at &lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt;). One of the common misconceptions is that when working with modal or tab forms, by mounting and unmounting form/inputs that inputs state will remain. That is incorrect. Instead, the correct solution would be to build a new form for your form inside each modal or tab and capture your submission data in local or global state and then do something with the combined data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- &lt;a href="https://react-hook-form.com/faqs#Howtoworkwithmodalortabforms"&gt;React Hook Form FAQs, "How to work with modal or tab forms?"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These bits of information, pieced together, answer the question of why every piece of data in a React Hook Form-based form must have an input associated with it, even if it's a hidden input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-leaky-abstraction"&gt;A Leaky Abstraction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't use the term "leaky abstraction" lightly because it has become a generic insult thrown around by developers online, lodged against any tool or library they don't like. However, this is a textbook leaky abstraction in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-abstraction"&gt;The Abstraction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm using React Hook Form to reduce the boilerplate of form state management.  I could write my own state management for any given form using only React built-ins like &lt;code&gt;useReducer&lt;/code&gt; or I guess a dozen or so &lt;code&gt;useState&lt;/code&gt; instances. But it's tedious, repetitive, and error-prone. If I choose to build this using React built-ins, the state of the form and the form inputs are completely separated from each other. If I should choose to conditionally render any of my input elements, the state representing the data of those inputs is unaffected. The data and its visual representation aren't dependent on one another.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-4"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would assume when I'm using a form state management library, it's doing this same stuff for me behind the scenes. It's just handling all of that tedious boilerplate code for me, but I assume the semantics, like a separation between data and view, would remain the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-leak"&gt;The Leak&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we saw, my assumptions were incorrect. As the docs said, React Hook Form depends intimately upon the input elements on the page to hold its state. This is an implementation detail of the library that you generally don't need to know or care about... until you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm willing to believe that my form is the edge case here. Most forms on the web can be built using React Hook Form and you'll never need to know about these implementation details. Most forms probably show all inputs every render. But we were improving UX so that users don't need to care about a required dropdown input if there's only one option to select from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to make it clear here that I'm not calling React Hook Form a leaky abstraction as an insult. I still mostly like the library, even if it's not built the same way I would choose to build it. I'm going to continue using it. I still prefer it to Formik. But this is an implementation detail, or perhaps a consequential design philosophy, that users should be aware of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because I regularly confuse the name as &lt;code&gt;react-form-hook&lt;/code&gt;, I've given up and lovingly refer to it as &lt;code&gt;react-man-door-hand-hook-car-door&lt;/code&gt; instead. I'm sure my coworkers have become tired of this joke.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fnref-1"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the second shout out to Emily on my blog! ‚ù§Ô∏è&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fnref-2"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note the docs' mention of combining the default data at the time of submission of the form. I did consider this approach after I'd already implemented an input component that intelligently used a hidden input when it made sense. But this approach wouldn't have worked in my case because I'm using schema validation to validate the form. Before I even got the chance to inject my default value, the validation would have failed and my submit function wouldn't have been called. I could have moved validation into my submit function, but then I'd lose the convenience of React Hook Form's built-in error messages. I guess I could make two versions of the schema, but who knows what unexpected gotchas that would uncover? It's a house of cards situation, and using a hidden input was the best choice.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fnref-3"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's been a couple of years since I've used Formik, but this is roughly how it operates IIRC. When I switched to working on a codebase using React Hook Form, I assumed this was still the case.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fnref-4"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

      <title>A formal letter of apology to Batman</title>
      <link>https://jaysherby.com/a-formal-letter-of-apology-to-batman/</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Batman,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this letter finds you well. It is with deep remorse and a heavy heart that I pen this formal apology to you. Recently, a rather unpleasant incident occurred within the confines of the sacred Bat Cave, an incident for which I must take full responsibility. I am truly sorry to inform you that I, Robin, was the culprit behind the unfortunate emission of flatulence in our esteemed headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a trusted member of the Dynamic Duo and your loyal crime-fighting companion, I understand the solemnity and sanctity of our crime-fighting operations. The Bat Cave serves as the epicenter of our collaborative efforts, where we strategize, analyze, and prepare for the challenges that await us in the perilous streets of Gotham City. It is a place of utmost professionalism, focus, and, of course, fresh air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The events leading up to the aforementioned mishap were rather innocuous. In hindsight, I admit to having consumed a hearty meal of beans, onions, and broccoli before our mission. My intentions were pure, as I sought to replenish my energy reserves for the arduous night of crime-fighting that lay ahead. Alas, the subsequent effects were unforeseen and regrettable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During our pursuit of the nefarious Joker, my attempt to stifle a brewing gaseous release proved futile. In a moment of weakness, a quiet but noxious emission escaped, infiltrating the air within the Bat Cave with an unsavory odor that cannot be easily forgotten. I apologize for subjecting you to such an unseemly and unbecoming spectacle, especially given the seriousness of our line of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batman, please understand that this occurrence was an unfortunate accident, an unintended consequence of my bodily functions.

      <title>HATEOAS: I want to believe</title>
      <link>https://jaysherby.com/hateoas-i-want-to-believe/</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a growing voice in the web dev community. I'm going to call them "web fundamentalists". They hold certain beliefs about web development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Single-page apps (SPAs) make for a poor user experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SPAs are bad for accessibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good APIs make semantically correct use of more of the HTTP verbs than just GET and POST.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's okay for an application server to return HTML.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The web should be generally usable with JavaScript disabled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cookie-based sessions are better than JSON Web Tokens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JavaScript doesn't need a compiler.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A web API that accepts and returns JSON isn't necessarily REST.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web applications should be offline-first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accessibility encompasses more than assistive technologies. An accessible application is tolerant of old hardware, old software, and poor connectivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boring tech makes for reliable tech.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Progressive enhancement is better than graceful degradation, but both are better than nothing at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with most, if not all, of these beliefs, in principle. However, I find that many of these beliefs are often overly idealistic and can fall apart when theory meets practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uphill-both-ways"&gt;Uphill both ways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like many forms of fundamentalism, this form is probably influenced by how quickly and drastically change has occurred. Web development looks completely different today than it did 10 years ago. In a rapidly changing environment, it's easy to fall prey to rose-tinted nostalgia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember when a web application generated all of a page's HTML on the server side. Slowly but surely, more and more logic would find its way into the templates. This was bad because template logic was generally slower than non-template logic. I have worked on applications where more than half of a server request's time was spent rendering the HTML. It was a bad time. In the short term, people started pushing so-called "logic-less templates". &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustache_%28template_system%29"&gt;Mustache templates&lt;/a&gt; became the new hotness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Longer term, the prevailing wisdom was that we needed to stop treating web browsers like thin clients. Can you believe there was ever any doubt? Web browsers are the thickest of thick clients. The web browser is the new operating system. Look at Chromebooks! People gladly buy laptops that can only run a glorified web browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If more than half of your server's workload is building HTML, basically shuffling strings around, you're paying to do something your client's devices are capable of doing on your behalf. Plus, there's so much redundant data going over the wire. You're sending your web app's navigation code for every page request. Ideally, you should amortize the templating and rendering by making your users' devices handle it. Your server doesn't have to do it, so you don't have to pay for the computer time or the data transfer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was there at the time and this made perfect sense. Your server only has to deal in pure data and your front-end code only needs to worry about displaying that data and performing server requests. This is what led to REST APIs and SPAs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But modern solutions call for modern problems and now we have to care about the efficiency with which data is represented and queried. None of that mattered previously because it all happened on the server. Your browser requested one whole page and the server returned one whole page. Since accessing the data and applying it to a template was essentially a single task accomplished by a single program running on a single machine, tightly coupling them wasn't a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With SPAs, you're encouraged to think of your server and your front-end as two different programs that happen to talk to one another. Wouldn't it be nice if your data representation wasn't tied to any particular display format? Your data is its own platonic ideal of entities and relationships, not all that different from a database. In fact, your application server isn't much more than a thin wrapper around your database. The only extra stuff it needs to do is authentication, authorization, data serialization (into JSON, the web's data serialization format of choice), and some data validation that's more application-specific than you can probably represent in a database alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="r-e-s-t-find-out-what-it-means-to-me"&gt;R-E-S-T, find out what it means to me&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representational state transfer, or REST, was the solution for what protocol the web was going to standardize on for this new world of front-ends and back-ends. Almost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;REST, at its heart, is basically a remote procedure call interface that plays to the strengths of the web's existing technology. Specifically, URIs, HTTP verbs, HTTP response codes, and browser caches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a problem, though, at least if you ask a REST purist. Nobody uses it "correctly".&lt;sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; You're technically not REST unless you're using HATEOAS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="only-love-can-conquer-hateoas"&gt;Only love can conquer HATEOAS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypermedia as the engine of application state, or HATEOAS. The name that just rolls off the tongue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not going to explain it in extreme detail here, but the idea, roughly, is that your API returns JSON objects that look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="json"&gt;{
  "author": {
    "id": 123,
    "firstName": "Stephen",
    "lastName": "King",
    "birthday": "1947-09-21T05:00:00.000Z",
    "links": {
      "books": "/authors/123/books"
    } 
  }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A given model contains all the information you'd expect, plus a &lt;code&gt;links&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;_links&lt;/code&gt; in some implementations) object containing the URIs of various related models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, at first blush, this seems like a really reasonable way to do things. It could benefit from some kind of library or something to automatically parse these things, but it's simple enough that almost any developer could probably roll their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there's at least one glaring flaw to me where the rubber meets the road, and it's when you need to traverse more than one relationship in the graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose, for example, my front-end is consuming an API like the one that would generate that Stephen King model above. I want to get a list of publishers who have published Stephen King's books. Imagine the &lt;code&gt;book&lt;/code&gt; model looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="json"&gt;{
  "book": {
    "id": 720,
    "title": "The Dead Zone",
    "pages": 428,
    "publicationDate": "1979-08-30T05:00:00.000Z",
    "isbn": "978-0-670-26077-5",
    "links": {
      "author": "/authors/123",
      "publisher": "/publishers/902"
    }
  }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I can do is request all of King's books with &lt;code&gt;GET /authors/123/books&lt;/code&gt; and then call a &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; on the &lt;code&gt;publisher&lt;/code&gt; link for each &lt;code&gt;book&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, subjectively speaking, this sucks. I don't know if you've ever had to work with an app that works this way, but it's a bad time for users. Best case scenario, this is going to take a lot of time and a lot of bandwidth due to the overhead of making one API per book. Even with HTTP/3 or whatever, where HTTP is no longer one transaction per connection. And the browser is going to choke if you fire off dozens of AJAX&lt;sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-3"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; requests at once.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-4"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, okay. I know that what I described is a ridiculous approach that I definitely have never seen in the wild, much less worked on an app that does it. What we'd actually do is add a new link to the &lt;code&gt;author&lt;/code&gt; model that does the relational hop for us on the back-end and return the results we want. Something like &lt;code&gt;/author/123/publishers&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know about you, but I hate adding boilerplate endpoints to apps. Seems like something metaprogramming would handle for you. There would need to be some guidelines from the programmer, though. If I just gave the program my database and told it to figure it out, I'd end up with technically valid but meaningless relationships.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-5"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Not to mention the cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I find myself describing almost exists already, but it's not HATEOAS. It's GraphQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know there are a lot of GraphQL haters out there. And I totally understand. It's not as simple to add GraphQL to an app as it is to incrementally add endpoints that speak JSON. Most GraphQL implementations, both front-end and back-end, are heavy-weight dependencies. And GraphQL itself is not a panacea for the problem of connecting front-end and back-end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've used GraphQL a few times in my career. Never for anything that's Serious Business‚Ñ¢Ô∏è. One time was in a Rails app. Another time was with Gatsby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What impressed me most about using it was the quality of the developer experience. Once you set up your models, querying data was a breeze. Introspection, auto-completion, and type inference made writing queries a joy. Having your data query live in the same file as your display logic was the same kind of revelation as when React gave us JSX and our templates could live with the display logic. It's a code locality win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combine that with Prisma's tooling&lt;sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-6"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-6"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; on the back-end and the need to write boilerplate endpoints virtually disappears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GraphQL also solves the problem of data validation and sanitation, which HATEOAS doesn't address. Neither solves the problem of authorization, though. My point is that metaprogramming can't account for all the drudgery associated with a CRUD back-end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-other-hateoas"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; HATEOAS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's get pedantic for a second. I talked about HATEOAS and I gave an example using JSON. The example I gave is an example of HATEOAS, but it's just one implementation. The most important word in HATEOAS is "hypermedia". The JSON examples I gave qualify as hypermedia because they have links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know what else qualifies as hypermedia? The OG, HTML! Hyper text markup language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some folks who have made various tools exploring this idea of HTML as HATEOAS. Their latest creation is &lt;a href="https://htmx.org/"&gt;HTMX&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it would be worth trying to create a web application using HTMX. The problem is, it bucks the trends of Big JavaScript‚Ñ¢Ô∏è.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can have the things that make development easier:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Templates and display logic live together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data queries and display logic live together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No more endpoint boilerplate hell... maybe?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The catch is, you'll be going back to rendering your HTML on the server side. But at least you don't have to render &lt;em&gt;entire&lt;/em&gt; pages per request. You can absolutely return page fragments that get inserted into an existing page.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-7"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-7"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wrapping-up"&gt;Wrapping up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't mean to be overly critical of the web dev hippies out there. I see you. I love you. I agree with you most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am critical of JSON HATEOAS implementations. Without some kind of tools for metaprogramming, I've found it leads to boilerplate fatigue. I don't enjoy churning out CRUD endpoints. I also hate when adding a new endpoint leads to a large impact radius in the code. Adding one new model, for example, is one thing. But then I have to modify all the endpoints of all the other models that contain relationships to the new endpoint that I want to utilize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think JSON HATEOAS implementations are inherently bad. How can they be? They're implementations. I don't think hypermedia is bad. How could I? The whole web is built on it. I do think that hypermedia is often an inappropriate medium to drive some of the applications we use it for. But, to its credit, hypermedia is adaptable enough that we can usually bend it into something resembling the shape we desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have found that GraphQL, as a query language, seems a lot more powerful than JSON HATEOAS implementations to quickly produce maintainable web applications. But it's mostly due to the quality of its assistive tools. If I had to write GraphQL queries by hand with nothing to help me, I would probably be complaining about it, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;REST is an architectural style, not a standard. Therefore, "correctness" is up to interpretation.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fnref-1"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Correct" REST can be pretty controversial. For example, server-side sessions are technically disallowed, whether that means using a session ID in a cookie or as part of the URI. This is because sessions introduce state, whereas REST is supposed to be stateless. Also, sessions mean there is data which is opaque to the user, which is deemed a security and privacy risk. But what's the alternative? Sending credentials along with every request that needs it seems less secure to me (assuming sessions are implemented securely, which is a &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; assumption, I know). JSON Web Tokens are not opaque, for better or worse, but it's considered better practice to prefer a session token for systems where the application server &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the authentication authority.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fnref-2"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's 2023. Are we still calling this AJAX? This is just how the web works now, right? ü§∑&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fnref-3"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask me how I know.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fnref-4"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My library card catalog example is too simple for an example, but anyone who has worked with a production database knows what I'm talking about.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fnref-5"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not a fan of ORMs generally, but I've found Ecto and Prisma to be the least objectionable in my experience so far. Neither is perfect, but I'm particularly impressed by Prisma's tooling, which generates Typescript types for your database models. We need more metaprogramming tools like this.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fnref-6"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-7"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I haven't tried this myself yet, but I'm very intrigued by the concept. The ultimate would be if all response bodies are complete HTML pages. I'm not sure how that would work. Iframes everywhere seems too heavy. It just feels weird to me to return HTML &lt;em&gt;fragments&lt;/em&gt; from a back-end.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fnref-7"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

      <title>Fact Check: Is Svelte Ditching Typescript?</title>
      <link>https://jaysherby.com/fact-check-is-svelte-ditching-typescript/</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id="claim"&gt;Claim:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Svelte is dropping Typescript in favor of JSDoc comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rating"&gt;Rating:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;‚úÖ|‚ùå&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Mixed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A choice made by Svelte's creator, Rich Harris, rocked the web dev community today. If you're unfamiliar, Svelte is a front-end component framework that rides the fence between JavaScript framework and programming language. The seemingly contentious decision was to alter how the internal compiler uses Typescript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/8569"&gt;The pull request&lt;/a&gt;, which was locked as "too heated" earlier today after it trended on Hacker News, at first glance may look like Typescript is being ditched for plain, old JavaScript. However, looks can be deceiving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As explained in &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/MJHO6FSioPI"&gt;a video&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Rich_Harris/status/1350436286948122625"&gt;a tweet&lt;/a&gt; by Harris, Typescript is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; being ditched. Instead, the Svelte compiler code is moving towards an interesting and often overlooked feature of Typescript: &lt;a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsdoc-supported-types.html"&gt;JSDoc Typescript&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been using Typescript as my primary front-end language for about five years now, and I must admit I didn't know JSDoc TS was a thing until today. And I think Harris may be on to something here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JSDoc TS uses special doc comment annotations that the Typescript compiler understands to add most of the benefits of Typescript's type checking to bog standard JavaScript code. The major advantage, which is the primary reason behind Harris's choice, is that you get the rich type-checking guarantees of Typescript without the required build step to strip out the Typescript and turn your code back into JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember a time when there were no build steps required to develop a rich, interactive website. Then we started breaking out our files into modules, which is generally a good thing. But this requires a build step to at least concatenate all of your source files together before your code can run in the browser. More build steps were added until we ended up with a build &lt;em&gt;pipeline&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lamenting the loss of the simplicity of web development is so common that it's become a meme in developer circles. But the good news is that with overwhelming support of &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules"&gt;modules&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script/type/importmap"&gt;import maps&lt;/a&gt; in browsers, I think we're closer than ever to returning to a build-less front-end world. But I don't want to give up the advantages of Typescript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe JSDoc TS is the best of both worlds? I'm willing to give it a shot next time I start a small personal project.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Promise Of WebAssembly</title>
      <link>https://jaysherby.com/the-promise-of-webassembly/</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Original art: Waluigi with the WebAssembly logo" src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/jaysherby-1683073239-0.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some people out there who are &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; excited for WebAssembly (herein referred to as WASM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally, I didn't see what the fuss was about. WASM, in its purest form, is a binary executable format for running code within a web browser. The potential benefits to using WASM over JavaScript, the &lt;em&gt;lingua franca&lt;/em&gt; of the web, seem to be few. You &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; get better performance, but that's only for pure computation. As soon as you want to actually do something using a browser API, you have to cross the contextual barrier between WASM and JavaScript, as well as paying the cost for data serialization and deserialization. At least, that's the conventional wisdom. If you want to enjoy your performance boost, you have to limit your interaction with the browser as much as possible. I'm sure this will change as implementations improve and the WASM-browser interface expands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another advantage (or disadvantage, depending on who you ask) is that your code is passed onto users in a binary format. It can still be reverse-engineered, but not as readily as JavaScript which, even when minified or obfuscated, is still passed to the user in source format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest advantage in favor of WASM is that many languages, especially C, C++, and Rust, can target it. That means porting existing software to work on the web is suddenly much easier. But that seems like a pretty niche benefit, all things considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="write-once-run-anywhere"&gt;Write once, run anywhere&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people more visionary than myself saw something more. Here's a binary executable format that can run almost anywhere by design, can run at almost native speed, and doesn't come with the baggage of everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's relatively simple to implement, too. If you have an hour and want to be gobsmacked, check out &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-A78RgMhZU"&gt;A Talk Near the Future of Python (a.k.a., Dave live-codes a WebAssembly Interpreter)&lt;/a&gt;, the closing keynote from PyCon India 2019, where, just as the title promises, David Beazley writes a WASM interpreter in Python that runs fast enough to play a game written in Rust and compiled to WASM. There's no magic going on, either. I was able to follow it all the way through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to these factors, the scene is now bursting with WASM runtimes for use outside of the context of web browsers. &lt;a href="https://wasmtime.dev/"&gt;Wasmtime&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://wasmer.io/"&gt;Wasmer&lt;/a&gt; seem to be the leading choices at the moment, but I expect that to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WASM could deliver on Java's promise of "write once, run anywhere" but better. This is going to be controversial, but perhaps the biggest problem with the JVM is... Java! With WASM, you can more or less bring your own language. Plenty of languages can already target WASM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="capability-based-security"&gt;Capability-based security&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as WASM within the browser goes, there are arguments that WASM's inherent obfuscation could be a boon for malware writers. There have already been examples of web-based crypto miners in the wild. But there have been examples of this in JavaScript, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we step outside of the browser, things start to look at little brighter. Stand-alone WASM runtimes like those mentioned above implement a capability-based security system. If you want to run an untrusted WASM executable, the only resources the program has access to is CPU cycles and a limited amount of RAM. Doing anything more than that, like accessing the network or the file system, are opt-in settings. The APIs to access these resources from within a WASM program are such that a program can detect what resources it can access, meaning a program could theoretically still work without certain permissions, meaning it would be acceptable for a user to choose not to permit certain capabilities if the features those capabilities require are not needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The closest analogous feature most people are familiar with would be smart phone apps. You can still use the Slack app on your phone, for example, without permitting it to access your phone's microphone. You just won't be able to send voice notes or join huddles without it. But if you're cool with that, don't give the app those permissions. It'll still work just fine otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="universal-scripting-and-plugin-format"&gt;Universal scripting and plugin format&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to allowing users to automate your application, you usually need to choose a scripting language. Lua is exceedingly easy to embed into an application. Python is a common choice because it's such a ubiquitous language. And there are tons of other options as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if you chose WASM as your scripting/plugin interface? That's exactly the question &lt;a href="https://extism.org/"&gt;Extism&lt;/a&gt; solves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add Extism to your application, create and document whatever application API you want to expose to plugins, and off you go! It's a really clever solution. Your power users no longer have any excuses to complain about the language you chose for scripting. They can choose any language that compiles to WASM, which is almost all of the mainstream languages, and some more obscure choices to boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="in-an-alternate-universe-an-alternative-to-docker"&gt;In an alternate universe, an alternative to Docker?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What got me thinking about this in the first place was &lt;a href="https://wasmer.io/posts/announcing-wcgi"&gt;this recent post&lt;/a&gt; on the Wasmer blog, written by Michael Bryan. It describes how to use WASM applications as Common Gateway Interface programs. This got me excited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoy programming. I don't enjoy system administration. That's why I prefer using services like &lt;a href="https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/"&gt;NearlyFreeSpeech&lt;/a&gt; to develop my hobby web apps, as opposed to more full-fat solutions like AWS. I deploy websites like it's 1999. NearlyFreeSpeech gives you the ability to log in with a shell over SSH, or transfer files to your little cubby of their web server using SFTP. You can go all-out with modern web apps that are constantly running their own servers alongside the web server using FastCGI, etc. But for small apps without a ton of traffic, regular, old CGI still works just fine.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CGI is cool because it's language-agnostic. Like WASM, bring your own language. But not all is cool with writing CGI scripts and programs. You might need to compile your program. Or you might need certain dependencies to be present on the server running your CGI program. That's where this gets tricky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NearlyFreeSpeech runs a BSD on their servers.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I don't run any BSDs locally. That means I'd have to build my CGI programs on their servers every time I make a change. Also, I'd have to bring my own dependencies, too, and build them if necessary. This sucks. I might like running my web apps like it's 1999, but I don't like building software in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now imagine a service like NearlyFreeSpeech, but all CGI programs had to be WASM binaries that will get run via Wasmer (or similar). I think that's a really compelling vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes deployment easy. I would deploy my programs the same as static resources like web pages. Debugging would be easy since I could run the exact same executable from production on my local machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my mind, I see this as an alternative to the popular Docker-based workflows that have proliferated. Most platforms have become container-friendly in the past few years. One of the most turn-key web app hosting solutions out there is indie darling &lt;a href="https://fly.io/"&gt;fly.io&lt;/a&gt;. It's a compelling proposition for devs who don't want to also be devops. Although fly.io doesn't run Docker or Podman directly, they do use a file format that's mostly compatible with Dockerfiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As great as containers are, they're not a complete panacea for web development. You're still shipping an entire userspace with your application, with all of the complications and vulnerabilities that entails. I've also had container-based development bite me since I started using an M1 Mac at work. All our software is deployed in x86_64 containers. I can't just grab those and run them locally since my development machine is ARM-based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With WASM, I don't have to worry about the differences between my development machine and the servers I deploy to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-wild-trend-appears"&gt;A wild trend appears?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WASM isn't the only web tech that's being co-opted for non-web usage. I recently happened upon a resource called &lt;a href="https://eliemichel.github.io/LearnWebGPU/"&gt;Learn WebGPU&lt;/a&gt; that surprised me by using the WebGPU interface &lt;a href="https://eliemichel.github.io/LearnWebGPU/introduction.html#why-webgpu"&gt;outside of the browser&lt;/a&gt;. The author's reasoning makes sense to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm shocked by this trend. When I started my career, the world was still asking how to use desktop and server technologies inside the browser. The tables have turned and now everyone wants to benefit from the standardization, support, and ubiquity of web tech elsewhere in the computing landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxYjsZr1PwM"&gt;Doc Brown in Back To The Future: Part III&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Young Doc:&lt;/strong&gt; No wonder this circuit failed. It says "Made in Japan".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marty McFly:&lt;/strong&gt; What do you mean, Doc? All the best stuff is made in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Young Doc:&lt;/strong&gt; Unbelievable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;PHP is less of a hassle than even CGI, but I have to be in the mood to write PHP.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fnref-1"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think they use FreeBSD, but I don't remember for sure and I couldn't be bothered to check.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fnref-2"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Counting My Chickens Before They Hatch</title>
      <link>https://jaysherby.com/counting-my-chickens-before-they-hatch/</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Original art: Cucco from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild" src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/jaysherby-1682818406-0.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made &lt;a href="https://jaysherby.com/three-hens-three-eggs-three-days/"&gt;a post&lt;/a&gt; yesterday about a particular word problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"3 hens lay 3 eggs in 3 days. How many eggs do 12 hens give in 12 days?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I eventually looked at the problem from the point of view of a pattern recognition problem to see if the incorrect answer of 12 would ever make sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was falling asleep last night, that pattern was stuck in my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3, 3, 3, 12, 12, 48&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I described it in my blog post as two sequences happening simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One sequence is [...] taking the previous value and multiplying it by 4. But also, the number of times that value is repeated in the sequence is reduced by 1 each time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This explanation didn't satisfy me. There's something else going on here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got out of bed and went to my whiteboard. The first thing I did was assign each place in the sequence a value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;a, b, c, x, y, z&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; are the number of hens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; are the number of days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt; is the number of eggs we already know relative to the values of &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt; is the number of eggs we want to figure out relative to the values of &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a relationship here. If you plug in the example problem of &lt;em&gt;3, 3, 3, 12, 12, 48&lt;/em&gt;, the relationship soon emerges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; / &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; = 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; / &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; = 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 * 4 = 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16 * &lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt; = 48.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt; / &lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt; = 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried different combinations of numbers, especially including values where &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; / &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; ‚â† &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; / &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;. The relationship held.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I generalized the relationship into an algebraic equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt; = ( &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; / &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; ) * ( &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; / &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; ) * &lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because multiplication is commutative, the assigned values of &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; can be swapped so long as &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; are also swapped. But &lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt; must be the produced quantities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="enter-leibniz"&gt;Enter Leibniz&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the hell did I just discover? After a little research this morning, this appears to be an application of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_rule"&gt;product rule&lt;/a&gt;, originally discovered by Gottfried Leibniz in the late 1600s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="about-those-sat-questions"&gt;About those SAT questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my blog post from yesterday, I mentioned how much I hate those SAT pattern recognition questions because the human mind is capable of finding a pattern to fit almost any sequence. Does this formula constitute a pattern?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The variables in my equation have very specific meanings. Plugging in random numbers will always result in an answer, but it will be devoid of meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; turn this into a sequence, though. Every sixth number in the sequence is the result of plugging the previous five numbers into my formula. We can keep going on like that forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a precedent for this type of relationship: the Fibonacci sequence. It's a sequence. It's right there in the name. It's a much simpler sequence from mine since each number is calculated using only the previous &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; elements of the sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, I have successfully defined a sequence. The problem with this is, if I'm allowed to introduce constants into my equation, given enough time I can deduce an equation that will fit any of the possible answers given to me in a multiple choice SAT question. All answers are equally valid. That means every question like this should be answered with the "not enough information" choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as I'd like to blow up this entire class of question, there is one major exception. My explanation only holds &lt;em&gt;if the element you're being asked to identify is the next element in the sequence&lt;/em&gt;. If you are given elements of the sequence after the one you're being asked to identify, the number of equations that can describe the sequence is finite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you were interested, here are the first 20 elements of the pattern. It's not too interesting since it almost immediately flies off towards infinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;12&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;12&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;48&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;768&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;12288&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Three Hens, Three Eggs, Three Days</title>
      <link>https://jaysherby.com/three-hens-three-eggs-three-days/</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Original art: Exeggcute, an egg-like Pok√©mon" src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/jaysherby-1682722199-0.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read a blog post about cognitive biases this week that included this word problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"3 hens lay 3 eggs in 3 days. How many eggs do 12 hens give in 12 days?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was presented to grade school children, and everyone, including the teacher but excluding the post's author, thought the answer was 12 eggs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-correct-answer"&gt;The correct answer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The correct answer is 48 eggs. The correct way to find the answer is to deduce logically that when 3 hens, &lt;em&gt;total&lt;/em&gt;, lay 3 eggs, &lt;em&gt;total&lt;/em&gt;, in 3 days, that means each hen takes 3 days to lay a single egg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12 days divided by 3 days is 4. A single hen will lay 4 eggs in 12 days. Multiply 4 eggs by 12 hens and there will be a total of 48 eggs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-counter-example"&gt;The counter-example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This word problem reminds me of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law"&gt;Brooks's law&lt;/a&gt;, popularly shared as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"nine women can't make a baby in one month"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seems like a good counter-example to help those who find the answer to the hens problem to be 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 women can make 9 babies in 9 months. How many babies can &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; women make in &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; months, where &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; is less than 9?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="right-answer-wrong-method"&gt;Right answer, wrong method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hens problem has some implied logic to it that can trip up the mind. If it was worded as "3 hens lay 1 egg each over the course of 3 days", I doubt there would be any difficulty to this problem at all. But the way it's worded is purposely ambiguous and implies prior knowledge of how hens lay eggs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's strip all of the implicit knowledge from the problem. 3 widgets produce 3 gizmos in 3 days. How many gizmos do 12 widgets produce in 12 days?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't really know &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; widgets produce gizmos. We only know that 3 widgets produce 3 gizmos in 3 days. For all we know, producing gizmos is a group effort and 3 widgets are able to collaborate such that they can create 1 gizmo every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we assume that, 3 widgets can create 12 gizmos in 12 days. 12 widgets is 4 times as many as 3 widgets, so they should be able to create 4 times as many gizmos in the same amount of time. 12 gizmos times 4 is 48 gizmos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's still the right answer despite coming to the wrong logical conclusion about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; a &lt;del&gt;widget&lt;/del&gt; hen produces &lt;del&gt;a gizmo&lt;/del&gt; an egg. In fact, I suspect that the numbers 3 and 12 were specifically chosen for this word problem exactly so that division leaves no remainder, meaning that either approach results in the correct answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the number of days and hens was 13, for example, they'd lay 52 eggs. A hen either lays an egg or doesn't. It doesn't lay a third of an egg per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of widgets and gizmos, we'd have to decide whether a single widget would be able to produce a single gizmo in 3 days, or if a gizmo is unable to be produced &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt; without 3 widgets participating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pattern-recognition"&gt;Pattern recognition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The typical reason as to why a person might jump to the conclusion that the answer is 12 eggs is that they see a pattern in the numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3, 3, 3, 12, 12, ?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably the correct answer to why people would answer "12 eggs". The brain is a connection-making machine, for better &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; worse. But is 12 a valid answer to &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; question, or are we being deceived?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a common format for SAT questions. You are given a sequence of numbers and asked to give the next number in the pattern. It's considered such a fundamental logic problem that there are versions for younger people that use shapes and colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These SAT questions are often multiple choice. The test-taker is given three or four possible answers and a choice of "not enough information", meaning there's either no discernible pattern, or there are multiple possible patterns and you haven't been given enough of the sequence to discern one and only one pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;hate&lt;/em&gt; these questions. As I said, the brain is a connection-making machine. We find patterns where there aren't any.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, I would argue that the correct answer would actually be "not enough information".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next number in the sequence could be 12. The pattern would start with a sequence of three numbers. To determine the next number in the pattern, find the number in the sequence whose index is 3 less than the number we're trying to determine and multiply that number by 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3, 3, 3, 12, 12, 12, 48, 48, 48, 192, 192, 192...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, let me offer an alternative pattern that also fits. The next number in the sequence could be 48. In this alternative pattern, we're looking at two sequences in one. One sequence is, like the previous one, taking the previous value and multiplying it by 4. But also, the number of times that value is repeated in the sequence is reduced by 1 each time. The next number in that sequence is the last number in the sequence since the number of repetition would be zero for the next iteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3, 3, 3, 12, 12, 48.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sequence can't go any further forward, but it could go on backwards towards infinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;...¬≥‚ÅÑ‚ÇÅ‚ÇÜ, ¬≥‚ÅÑ‚ÇÅ‚ÇÜ, ¬≥‚ÅÑ‚ÇÅ‚ÇÜ, ¬≥‚ÅÑ‚ÇÅ‚ÇÜ, ¬≥‚ÅÑ‚ÇÅ‚ÇÜ, ¬æ, ¬æ, ¬æ, ¬æ, 3, 3, 3, 12, 12, 48.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the correct answer to the question of what the next number in the sequence &lt;em&gt;3, 3, 3, 12, 12, ?&lt;/em&gt; cannot be determined without more information about the sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-moral"&gt;The moral&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moral to the story, if there is one at all, is not to trust your lizard brain when it comes to logic problems. Or trust, but also verify. Our brains are &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; good at finding patterns and correlations, we tend to see them where they don't exist at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wanna see more chicken-egg-day shenanigans? I wrote &lt;a href="https://jaysherby.com/counting-my-chickens-before-they-hatch/"&gt;even more&lt;/a&gt; about this the day after this post.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Block Users In Auth0 From The Command Line</title>
      <link>https://jaysherby.com/block-users-in-auth0-from-the-command-line/</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Original art, one of the Blockheads from Gumby" src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/jaysherby-1682188602-0.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://jaysherby.com/terraform-cloud-cdktf-auth0/"&gt;previously established&lt;/a&gt;, I use Auth0 at work. Whenever a client decides not to renew their contract, which I'm thankful is an uncommon event&lt;sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, I have to collect each user's email address from our application, search for their account in the Auth0 web app, and block each user.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It's a tedious process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've only had to do this process once so far. But being a developer, I immediately wanted to automate this process with a shell script. With Auth0's web app, it takes a copy/paste and 4 clicks &lt;em&gt;per user&lt;/em&gt; I'm blocking. That's unacceptable. After the first half-dozen users, my eyes lose focus and my mind starts to wander. And that's when the odds I'll make a mistake spike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the push I needed to finally install Auth0's command line tool, &lt;a href="https://github.com/auth0/auth0-cli"&gt;auth0-cli&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After authenticating with &lt;code&gt;auth0 login&lt;/code&gt;, the first step will be finding the user's ID based on their email address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="bash"&gt;auth0 users search -q email:"user1@example.com"
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most commands in auth0-cli have a &lt;code&gt;--json&lt;/code&gt; option to print their output in JSON format, which will make it easy to grab what I need by piping the output to &lt;a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/"&gt;jq&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With some error handling in case I receive anything besides exactly one result from my query, I'll have the user's ID. Using that, I should be able to block the user by... uh....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's see.... I can delete users using &lt;code&gt;auth0 users delete&lt;/code&gt;, but as I mentioned before, that's not application in my case. I can "view" blocks&lt;sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-3"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; on particular users via &lt;code&gt;auth0 users blocks list&lt;/code&gt;, and I can unblock users with &lt;code&gt;auth0 users blocks unblock&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait, what!? There doesn't seem to be any way to block a user via auth0-cli. How can that be? Isn't this one of the most common use cases for the tool?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If auth0-cli isn't up to the task, what are my options? I could script my browser, but that's awfully heavy-handed for a service that has an API. I could use the official Auth0 management API either via &lt;a href="https://curl.se/"&gt;curl&lt;/a&gt; or a package in my favorite programming language. But this is actually really inconvenient compared to using auth0-cli, specifically because of authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With auth0-cli, I'm authenticated via my personal Auth0 management user account. It's no harder and no different from signing into the Auth0 management web app. If I wanted to use the Auth0 management API via other means, I'd have to use an ID/secret pair from an "application" (in Auth0's parlance). I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; use the production creds our app uses, but that would be horrendous opsec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could create a temporary "application" to run this script and then delete it when I'm done. That's pretty inconvenient, though. If my shell script turns out well, I'd like to be able to share it with my coworkers in case they ever need to perform this kind of task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I felt like building a Rube Goldberg machine, maybe I could script the creation of a temporary "application" using auth0-cli and delete it when the script is done....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ugh. Feels Bad, Man‚Ñ¢. I ended up just doing the task manually. It was going to take more time to automate this than to do it by hand.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-4"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, I made &lt;a href="https://github.com/auth0/auth0-cli/issues/683"&gt;a feature request&lt;/a&gt; for the ability to block users using the command line tool. &lt;a href="https://github.com/ewanharris"&gt;Ewan Harris&lt;/a&gt;, a developer at Auth0, left &lt;a href="https://github.com/auth0/auth0-cli/issues/683#issuecomment-1491734214"&gt;a very helpful reply&lt;/a&gt; that pointed out a feature of the command line tool that I completely overlooked: &lt;code&gt;auth0 api&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;auth0 api&lt;/code&gt; command is essentially a passthrough that lets you call the management REST API directly using the credentials auth0-cli already has, contrasting the limited porcelain the tool provides. In other words, it's exactly what I was looking for! According to Ewan Harris, this would do the trick: &lt;code&gt;auth0 api patch &amp;amp;quot;users/&amp;amp;lt;user_id&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot; --data &amp;amp;quot;{\&amp;amp;quot;blocked\&amp;amp;quot;:true}&amp;amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is usually where I'd share a neat little shell script you can use to do this task. However, I haven't had occasion to need it. If that day comes, I'll write a shell script that takes a list of email addresses and blocks their user accounts. I'll try to share it here. In the meantime, you should have all the tools you need to do it yourself using auth0-cli and jq.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi, HR! Thanks for reading! ‚úåÔ∏èüòú&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fnref-1"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is for the "why don't you just..." crowd. This is about a proprietary application owned by my employer, so I can't go into detail. But trust me that I can't delete the Auth0 accounts, and there's no in-application flag I can set to block a user at the moment.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fnref-2"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;TIL there's more to blocking users in Auth0 than blocking them by hand like I'm doing. Apparently there are Auth0 features for automatically blocking new users who exhibit bot-like behavior. This was news to me as my employer's application is a fairly niche web app for medical clinics. We're not seeing nearly enough traffic to be subject to scripted sign-ups.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fnref-3"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://xkcd.com/1205/"&gt;https://xkcd.com/1205/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fnref-4"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
